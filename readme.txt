FLUX is a spiritual successor to the ghost FLELE: http://navy.nm.land.to/ukgk/flele/

It is currently available in the following languages:
- English
- Russian
- German
- Spanish

FLUX features a robust music player, and can save and load playlists in the same format as FLELE (and some other music players). You can also install different shells to change the look of FLUX, some of which may include custom dialogue.

It is backwards compatible with FLELE, and should be able to install FLELE shells as long as FLELE is closed. If you find a FLELE shell that is not compatible, please contact me.

I list all known FLUX shells on my website:

You can find many FLELE shells scattered across the web. You might try these links as a starting point:

Many shells have hotspots you can double click to control the player. Please see the readme file of each individual shell for instructions. To view the readme of the current shell, click on FLUX, press F1, and change the tab to "Shell information..."

If you find any bugs or other issues, please contact me via my links at the bottom of my website: https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/

If you want to make your own shell for FLUX, there is documentation in the make_your_own_shell folder within FLUX's files.

If you're interested in translating FLUX to a new language, there is information in translating_flux.txt in FLUX's files. Get in contact with me and I can help you with this process!

Many thanks to the folks who have translated FLUX!
